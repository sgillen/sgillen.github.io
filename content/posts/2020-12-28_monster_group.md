I consider the Classification of finite simple groups to be one of the most important and fascinating results in all of mathematics. This was an effort starting starting in the 1950s and lasting over 50 years, it saw the combined efforts of hundreds of mathematicians and tens of thousands of pages worth of proofs. The result is that all finite simple groups can be categorized as either a cyclic group, an alternating group, a lie group, or one of 26 sporadic groups. 

Maybe this doesn't sound so exciting, but let me try to convince you how unintuitive this is. The finite simple groups are analogous to the prime numbers for the integers, in the sense that they are the basic building blocks for groups. So imagine that all prime numbers were found to follow some pattern, except for 17, 181, 112,689,833 and 314,263,866,547,941,106,324,656,442,766,609,555,269! The arbitrary nature of some of the sporadic groups blows my mind too. The monster group is of order 808,017,424,794,512,875,886,459,904,961,710,757,005,754,368,000,000,000. I have never seen a satisfory explanation for WHY this might be. And it's crazy to me that the axioms of group theory somehow necessitate the existence of these groups. The axioms are very simple!, I'll post them here.


>A group is a set G together with an binary operation on G, often denoted ⋅, that combines any two elements a and b to form another element of G, denoted a ⋅ b, in such a way that the following three >requirements, known as group axioms, are satisfied:[5][6][7]

>Associativity
>For all a, b, c in G, one has (a ⋅ b) ⋅ c = a ⋅ (b ⋅ c).
>Identity element
>There exists an element e in G such that, for every a in G, one has e ⋅ a = a and a ⋅ e = a. Such an element is unique (see below). It is called the identity element of the group.
>Inverse element
>For each a in G, there exists an element b in G such that a ⋅ b = e and b ⋅ a = e, where e is the identity element. For each a, the element b is unique (see below); it is called the inverse of a and >is commonly denoted a−1.

I want to talk about the monster group.
